\* At least one sensor entity is required. Use any combination that fits your setup.

### Air Quality Index entity

The optional `air_quality_entity` is a **passthrough**: whatever value the entity reports is shown directly on the status badge (lowercased and mapped to a color based on standard HA AQI states — `good` / `moderate` / `fair` / `poor` / `very_poor` / `extremely_poor`). The card doesn't interpret it as indoor or outdoor — use whichever entity fits your dashboard.

If you leave it unset, the card computes the status itself from your configured CO / CO₂ / PM2.5 / radon sensors (CO and radon are prioritized as life-safety/health concerns).

### Sensor Order

Customize which sensors come first on the card. In the visual editor, use the multi-select to tick metrics in the order you want them shown. In YAML, provide a list of metric names. Any metric you don't list keeps its default position and stays visible.

Valid metric names: `co`, `radon`, `co2`, `pm25`, `pm10`, `pm1`, `pm03`, `pm4`, `hcho`, `tvoc`, `nox`, `humidity`, `temperature`, `pressure`.

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
co2_entity: sensor.air_quality_co2
humidity_entity: sensor.air_quality_humidity
temperature_entity: sensor.air_quality_temp
pm10_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm10
pm25_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm25
order:
  - temperature
  - humidity
  - co2
  - pm10
  - pm25
```

### Recommendation Action Button

Surface a one-tap button on the recommendation strip to act on what the card suggests — e.g. turn on an air purifier when it recommends "Run Air Purifier", or run a script. Uses Home Assistant's [standard action](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/) format, so it supports `perform-action`, `toggle`, `navigate`, `url`, `more-info`, etc. The button appears only when there's an actionable recommendation (hidden when air quality is "All Good").

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
co2_entity: sensor.air_quality_co2
pm25_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm25
recommendation_action:
  action: perform-action
  perform_action: homeassistant.toggle
  target:
    entity_id: fan.air_purifier
```

For per-recommendation routing (different action depending on whether it's a purifier vs. ventilation suggestion), point this at a script that branches on your sensor states.

### Compact Display Mode

For overview dashboards where you want a small "go to the air quality page" indicator, use `display: compact`. Renders just the title and the overall status badge, with optional [HA tap actions](https://www.home-assistant.io/dashboards/actions/).

When any sensor reads outside its normal range, small colored **alert chips** appear next to the badge naming the offenders (most severe first — CO and radon always lead — capped at 4 plus a `+N` overflow pill) — so a yellow badge tells you *what* is off without expanding. Set `compact_alerts: false` to turn the chips off. Atmospheric pressure never produces a chip or triggers auto-expand: it's informational, not an air-quality hazard.

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
name: Air Quality
co2_entity: sensor.air_quality_co2
pm25_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm25
display: compact
tap_action:
  action: navigate
  navigation_path: /lovelace/air-quality
```

Compact mode:
- Skips the history fetch (faster initial load)
- Status badge updates in real-time from current sensor values
- All three standard HA actions are supported: `tap_action`, `hold_action`, `double_tap_action`

### Expandable Display Mode

`display: expandable` starts as a compact summary and expands to the full card (graphs and details) when tapped — best of both worlds for space-constrained dashboards. A chevron indicates the toggle; tap the header again to collapse. History is fetched lazily the first time you expand.

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
name: Air Quality
co2_entity: sensor.air_quality_co2
pm25_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm25
display: expandable
```

In expandable mode the tap gesture is reserved for expand/collapse, so `tap_action` is ignored.

Add `auto_expand: true` to let the card manage itself: it expands automatically while any sensor reads out of range and collapses once readings have stayed normal for 5 minutes (the delay prevents flapping when a sensor hovers at a threshold). A manual tap takes over (the card stops auto-toggling until it is re-created, e.g. a page reload or dashboard edit), so the automation never fights you.

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
co2_entity: sensor.air_quality_co2
pm25_entity: sensor.air_quality_pm25
display: expandable
auto_expand: true
```

### Custom Thresholds

The default thresholds follow WHO 2021 / ASHRAE / EPA guidelines, but you can override any of them. Provide an array of **4 ascending numbers** — these become the 5-tier boundaries (Excellent / Good / Moderate / Elevated / Poor for most metrics; see [Health Thresholds](#health-thresholds) for the labels per metric).

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
temperature_entity: sensor.living_room_temp
temperature_unit: C
# In tropical climates, 26-29 °C is comfortable AC territory
temperature_thresholds: [22, 25, 28, 31]
# Stricter PM2.5 expectations than WHO 24h guideline
pm25_thresholds: [3, 8, 15, 25]
```

Notes:
- All custom thresholds are in the same unit as your sensor reports. For radon, the thresholds are always in **Bq/m³** — the card converts your sensor value before comparison.
- Invalid thresholds (wrong length, non-numeric, etc.) silently fall back to the defaults. No errors thrown.
- Colors are not customizable — only the boundaries between them.

### Language

The card auto-detects your Home Assistant frontend language and translates the status badge, recommendations, recommendation subtitles, radon advisory titles, and editor labels. Translations included so far: **English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese** (Spanish/French/German contributed by [@b0rv3g4r4](https://github.com/b0rv3g4r4) on PR #11, Portuguese by [@mzspicoli](https://github.com/mzspicoli) on PR #33).

If auto-detection picks the wrong language, force one explicitly with `language: es` (or `en` / `fr` / `de` / `pt`).

To contribute a new language: open a PR adding a block to the `TRANSLATIONS` const in `air-quality-card.js`. Copy the `en:` block, rename the key (e.g. `it:` for Italian), and translate the values — keep the structure identical. English is the fallback for any missing key.

### Outdoor Sensors

Configure outdoor sensor entities to see a **dashed comparison line** on each graph showing outdoor conditions alongside indoor readings. When outdoor sensors are configured:

- A subtle dashed line appears on the corresponding graph
- Hovering shows both indoor and outdoor values
- Current outdoor values appear next to indoor readings
- **Smart recommendations** avoid suggesting ventilation when outdoor air is worse (e.g., "Keep Windows Closed" instead of "Open Window")

### Outdoor-Only Mode

If you're using the card to monitor **only outdoor air quality** (e.g., a weather station or DIY ESPHome ambient sensor), you can configure just the `outdoor_*_entity` options. The card will:

- Render outdoor entities as primary graph lines
- Compute the status badge from the outdoor values using the same WHO thresholds
- **Hide the recommendation strip** — actions like "Open Window" or "Run Air Purifier" don't apply to ambient air

```yaml
type: custom:air-quality-card
name: Outdoor Air Quality
outdoor_pm25_entity: sensor.outdoor_pm25
outdoor_pm10_entity: sensor.outdoor_pm10
outdoor_temperature_entity: sensor.outdoor_temperature
```

## Built-in Recommendations

The card automatically generates actionable recommendations based on your sensor readings -- no template sensors needed. It evaluates CO, CO2, PM2.5, PM10, HCHO, tVOC, and humidity levels, and when outdoor sensors are configured, it avoids suggesting ventilation when outdoor air is worse.

**CO safety alerts** are always shown regardless of outdoor conditions -- carbon monoxide is a life-safety concern. If CO exceeds dangerous levels, the card shows a critical red warning with instructions to leave the area.

**Radon advisory banner** appears as a separate element below the main recommendation when radon levels are elevated. Unlike other pollutants, radon changes over days/weeks and requires professional mitigation (not "open a window"), so it uses its own advisory system instead of the main recommendation waterfall. The advisory shows at three levels: informational (approaching action level), warning (above EPA action level of 4.0 pCi/L / 148 Bq/m3), and danger (significantly elevated, mitigation needed).

## Health Thresholds

| Moderate | 50-100 ppb | Yellow | Consider ventilation |
| Elevated | 100-200 ppb | Orange | Ventilation needed |
| Poor | > 200 ppb | Red | Take action |

### tVOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)
The card auto-detects whether your sensor reports absolute concentration (ppb) or the unitless Sensirion VOC Index (0-500, centered at 100); force a mode with `tvoc_unit` if needed.

Absolute (ppb):
| Level | Range | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Excellent | < 100 ppb | Green | Clean air |
| Good | 100-300 ppb | Light Green | Acceptable |
| Moderate | 300-500 ppb | Yellow | Consider ventilation |
| Elevated | 500-1000 ppb | Orange | Ventilation needed |
| Poor | > 1000 ppb | Red | Take action |

VOC Index (Sensirion):
| Level | Range | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Excellent | < 100 | Green | Better than your home's average |
| Good | 100-150 | Light Green | Around average |
| Moderate | 150-250 | Yellow | Consider ventilation |
| Elevated | 250-400 | Orange | Ventilation needed |
| Poor | > 400 | Red | Take action |

### NOx (Nitrogen Oxides)
Like tVOC, NOx comes in two flavors and the card auto-detects which one your sensor reports (force with `nox_unit`). Sensirion SGP41-based sensors (AirGradient ONE / Open Air, ESPHome `sgp4x`) report the unitless **NOx Index** — note its clean-air baseline is **1**, not 100 like the VOC Index.

NOx Index (Sensirion) — bands follow Sensirion's integration guidance and AirGradient's dashboard:
| Level | Range | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Excellent | < 5 | Green | Clean-air baseline (1) |
| Good | 5-20 | Light Green | Minor activity |
| Moderate | 20-150 | Yellow | NOx event — Sensirion's "trigger an air purifier" level |
| Elevated | 150-300 | Orange | Significant NOx event — ventilate |
| Poor | > 300 | Red | Major NOx event |

Absolute (ppb) — anchored to WHO 2021 / EPA NO₂ standards (applied to NOx conservatively). If your sensor reports µg/m³ instead of ppb, the card displays that unit but the default thresholds still assume ppb — set `nox_thresholds` in your sensor's unit (for NO₂, 1 ppb ≈ 1.88 µg/m³):
| Level | Range | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Excellent | < 20 ppb | Green | ~WHO interim target 1 (40 µg/m³) |
| Good | 20-53 ppb | Light Green | Under the EPA annual NAAQS (53 ppb) |
| Moderate | 53-100 ppb | Yellow | Under the EPA 1-hour NAAQS (100 ppb) |
| Elevated | 100-360 ppb | Orange | EPA AQI Unhealthy-for-Sensitive-Groups range |
| Poor | > 360 ppb | Red | EPA AQI Unhealthy and above |

### Humidity
| Level | Range | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| Too Dry | < 30% | Orange | Use humidifier |
| Dry | 30-40% | Light Green | Acceptable |
| Comfortable | 40-50% | Green | Ideal range |
| Humid | 50-60% | Light Green | Acceptable |
| Too Humid | > 60% | Orange | Improve ventilation |

### Atmospheric Pressure
Informational, not a health hazard — a wide green band keeps typical weather calm. Thresholds assume **hPa / mbar** (what Airthings and most HA sensors report); override `pressure_thresholds` for other units.
| Level | Range (hPa) | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------------|-------|---------|
| Low | < 990 | Orange | Stormy / rapidly falling |
| Slightly Low | 990-1005 | Light Green | Below average |
| Normal | 1005-1025 | Green | Typical sea-level range |
| Slightly High | 1025-1040 | Light Green | Above average |
| High | > 1040 | Orange | Unusually high |
